This is even more true with mobile/web applications because you want your client apps to do as little as possible, and your service to do most of the heavy lifting. This allows you to improve your service without requiring constant client updates. Also since you have a single service that serves potentially various native clients (iOS, Android, or Windows Phone), being able to update it independently of your users gives you a clear competitive edge. So today I want to focus on building a service based on this notion of a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo;. Most .NET client/service frameworks already have this concept. For instance, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) has an execution pipeline, and so does ASP.NET. This allows you to extend the behavior of these frameworks at various points during the execution. But that&rsquo;s not really what I want to talk about today. I want to talk about how <em>you can build</em> your services such that you can add/remove functionality using a pipeline-style execution. As we are talking about the implementation of this pipeline I also want to take this opportunity to discuss good software design practices, and it&rsquo;s uses. <img src=/2013/04/service-execution-pipeline.png alt=service-execution-pipeline></p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/building-a-service-execution-pipeline/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/self-awareness/>Self-Awareness</a></h1><time datetime=2013-04-07T05:37:43Z class=post-date>Sun, Apr 7, 2013</time><p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Junger>Sebastian Junger</a> (pronounced Younger) was on Bill Maher last night. Junger is an award winning Afghanistan war correspondent, and director, and his latest documentary <a href=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13020/which_way_is_the_front_line_from_here_the_life_and_time_of_tim_hetherington>Which way is the front line from here?</a> has been proclaimed a success at the Sundance Film Festival this year. During the interview Bill asked why war felt like an addiction to some soldiers. In particular, what psychology drove this behavior? To that Sebastian responded: &ldquo;The consequences in war are huge. The consequences even of small things. You don&rsquo;t tie your shoe, you trip in a firefight, someone gets killed. And it gives you this strange almost Zen like focus on the details of life &ndash; and everything starts to feel very meaningful, and friendships feel meaningful, everything has this kind of intensity. And soilders miss that sense of meaning and the bond that arises in that situation&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a very insightful answer, and it&rsquo;s probably why it stuck with me. No matter what I was doing I kept thinking about what he said, and how it applied to everything we do. His response wasn&rsquo;t that soldiers do it for our country, or that they do it because they want to help humanity. While I am sure there&rsquo;s a component of that, the reality is from an individual&rsquo;s temporal perspective these grand reasons are too hard to see and therefore can&rsquo;t be the reason for motivation. I think to a certain degree the same is true for most professionals - it&rsquo;s arguable to compare a soldier to another profession but the general idea still applies. For instance, as software engineers, we build things that can change someone&rsquo;s life, and we like to think that is the reason why we do what we do. But is it really? When we are trying to solve a hard technical problem at midnight, are we really doing it because it has an impact on someone&rsquo;s life? Or is it something else? Self-awareness is key to happiness. If we know what it is that attracts us, we can certainly accentuate it or maybe even find other activities that lead to it. Without self-awareness the truth tends to hide behind social norms and hypes around you. The truth could hide even from yourself if you&rsquo;re not careful. If you are lucky enough to love what you do, spend a day, take a walk and ask yourself: what it is that you really enjoy. Keep peeling away until there&rsquo;s no more, and hopefully what you&rsquo;re left with is your kernel of happiness.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/self-awareness/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/introduction-to-machine-learning-2/>Introduction to Machine Learning</a></h1><time datetime=2013-04-01T07:39:37Z class=post-date>Mon, Apr 1, 2013</time><p>In most computer science programs, machine learning is usually a graduate level course. It&rsquo;s a specialization within the field of artificial intelligence, which is often thought of as a theoretical study than practical applications. But yet, machine learning today is used heavily to solve problems. Our team for instance, uses it to build acoustic models for speech recognition. It&rsquo;s no longer a theory, it&rsquo;s applied science. But if you wanted to start in this field, which I suspect is going to play a major role in software in the future, where do you start? I came across this free textbox from professor <a href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/>Max Welling</a> for UCI Computer Science. His textbook <a href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/273ASpring10/IntroMLBook.pdf>&ldquo;A First Encounter with Machine Learning&rdquo;</a> is available for free.

Static files are things that aren&rsquo;t going to change, things like CSS, JavaScript, images, documents, and so on. With IIS this is actually quite easy to achieve, you can start by making the following change to your web.config:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>&lt;system.webServer&gt;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There&rsquo;s a set of file extensions that&rsquo;s already mapped to staticContent - so IIS only applies this change to all static contents. Also notice that we are caching the content on the client side. This means returning visitors will see a performance boost and we cache it for 7 days on the client side. If you have file extensions that are not part of the standard staticContent extension list, you can easily add it by doing:</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/improving-wordpress-site-speed-on-iis/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/ads/>Ads</a></h1><time datetime=2013-03-20T17:34:58Z class=post-date>Wed, Mar 20, 2013</time><p>Came across this wonderful quote from <a href=http://jeffhammerbacher.com/>Jeff Hammerbacher</a>: &ldquo;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads&rdquo;.

One of my preferred approach to extending behaviors is composition, and that is what we are going to talk about today. Let&rsquo;s start with a simple example of inheritance:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>public</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>class</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>Search</span> : ISearch {

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>} 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So in this simple example, we extend Search and create Related - which provides some additional functionality.

It&rsquo;s important to me that my sites are 100% XHTML/strict compatible. But recently I came across a situation that I thought I simply couldn&rsquo;t get around. In this article I am going to show you how you can add the X-UA-Compatible attribute and at the same time validate your pages through W3C validation. My website had the following tag:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html><span style=display:flex><span> &lt;<span style=color:#f92672>meta</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>http-equiv</span><span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;X-UA-Compatible&#34;</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>content</span><span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;IE=edge,chrome=1&#34;</span>&gt;

While the X-UA-Compatible is a standard meta key, the value IE=edge is not, and therefore the validator gave me an error. So I finally figured it out, I removed the tag from my template and added the meta tag to the standard HTTP header via web.config:</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/ie-compatibility-and-w3c-validation/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/using-the-mvvm-pattern-on-web-applications-part-ii/>Using the MVVM pattern on web applications – Part II</a></h1><time datetime=2013-03-03T04:23:51Z class=post-date>Sun, Mar 3, 2013</time><p><a href=/blog/using-the-mvvm-pattern-on-web-applications-part-i/>Last time we looked at what the MVVM pattern was</a>, and how it is used today in XAML-based applications.

On{x} allows you to configure arbitrary actions during specific circumstances. For instance, on{x} provides an API called modeOfTransport. This API gives the developer the current mode of transportation - whether you are walking, running or driving. You can subscribe to a change in this event and build cool scenarios like when someone is going from driving to walking (imagine parking a car), your phone can automatically remember your parking location. On{x} also knows about your work location, your home, and other key areas of interest. So you can also trigger events, when you leave work, or arrive home and so on.

One that believes in integration tests, and the other that believes in both unit and integration tests. Integration tests are tests that execute everything as if they were real &ldquo;transactions&rdquo; only to verify the expected results. For instance, if you were building a web application that managed a list of employees and their supervisors. Your integration test would probably add an employee to the database (actually add it), and then read it back from that database, and so on (from a test database of course). There&rsquo;s nothing wrong this, and in fact I would argue these types of tests are great. You need to write integration tests that exercise your entire stack. Without it would be like exercising without doing cardio. What differentiates a unit test from other types of tests is that you test a &ldquo;unit&rdquo; of your application alone. Now what that unit is, is up to you. But the point is you take a <em>part</em> of your application and test it in <em>isolation</em>. That part could be a class, it could be multiple sets of classes, but not your application as a whole - otherwise it would become an integration test. Seems like we have a conundrum here. We just argued that a integration test, tests everything, end-to-end, the entire stack &ndash; and a unit test, tests a part of the application in isolation. Isn&rsquo;t integration test then a superset of unit tests? And there is where the confusion lies. <strong>So why write unit tests?</strong> While it is true that unit tests can often uncover bugs in the code, in reality unit tests actually help discover a far bigger problem; and that is design of your system. Unit tests can discover design issues if left unaddressed could severely impact your velocity to adapt to change. I would argue that if you can write proper tests for your system with good code coverage, then you have a well designed, cohesive system. Now unit testing alone is no silver bullet to design verification, but it&rsquo;s pretty close. Let&rsquo;s look at a really simple example:</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/how-do-you-test-your-software/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/using-the-mvvm-pattern-on-web-applications-part-i/>Using the MVVM pattern on web applications – Part I</a></h1><time datetime=2013-02-28T09:01:15Z class=post-date>Thu, Feb 28, 2013</time><p>In this series I will be discussing how the MVVM pattern can be used for almost any type of web application.

For instance, if you make an asynchronous WebRequest call – you may want to timeout this asynchronous operation within 3 seconds if you don’t get a response back. In the past, we had to create Timers to monitor the Task (or the Thread) for completion in the callback of the timer, and then do other crazy gymnastics to make it all play well together. However, the result was a code that was extremely difficult to understand because you had these disparate methods, without any cohesiveness within the code. With .NET 4.5 we can simplify this dramatically.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/task-timeouts/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/brief-introduction-to-prism/>Brief introduction to PRISM</a></h1><time datetime=2011-03-08T14:55:10Z class=post-date>Tue, Mar 8, 2011</time><p>Before I go into the technical details of this article. I want to provide some context for this discussion. So we are using <a href=http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/>PRISM</a> to develop a user-interface (UI) platform in the context of a Silverlight (but they apply to WPF also). The idea behind the UI platform is we will provide the basic functional look and feel and various plumbing (such as security, service encapsulation, messaging and exception handling, among others) and allow others to develop modules/components on top. PRISM allows us to do this quite well. Let’s assume for a second, you have a system where a user can initiate an order, and then track the shipment status of that order. PRISM allows us to separate the concerns of this applications into two distinct tasks. (1) ordering, and (2) shipment tracking (and perhaps even further, but let’s keep it simple). Each of these could be developed as separate modules, and therefore separate DLLs, and possibly by separate teams. In the end, with PRISM, we can <strong><em>dynamically compose</em></strong> these at runtime even though they are independent components. So if you can imagine for a second, all the base functionality that we talked earlier is hosted in a component itself usually referred to as the Shell. The Shell is like the hosting application, where everything comes together. If there’s any resemblance to web applications, as Masterpage is to a ASP.NET page, a Shell is to a Silverlight/WPF application. That’s one way to look at it. So that’s the general overview for our discussion. And you can get a lot of good content about PRISM from Karl Shifflett, John Papa. With PRISM (and also few other technologies like MEF) what we are able to do is we are able to surface modules on the fly based on a modules catalog (one of many ways). One key architectural decision we made early on was that the Shell would be independent of the modules – meaning the Shell does not have any strong references to the modules. This allows us to introduce new modules without actually recompiling the Shell. But many examples out there do exactly that, they either (1) add strong references to Modules from the Shell or (2) they use something known as a ModulesCatalog file. Which is a XAML file that weakly defines the modules list. But again, the ModulesCatalog.xaml file is backed into the Shell – and therefore part of the XAP. That brings us back to the some of the same restrictions. Part of the problem we have is we have several teams, teams that are out of control, developing modules. </p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/brief-introduction-to-prism/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/how-to-check-if-integrated-windows-authentication-is-available/>How to check if Integrated Windows Authentication is available?</a></h1><time datetime=2011-03-07T13:13:32Z class=post-date>Mon, Mar 7, 2011</time><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever worked on an intranet site, you often want to know, programmatically, if a client that&rsquo;s accessing your website has the ability to automatically login to your site (Integrated Windows Authentication). With Integration Windows Authentication, Windows can basically send (as a HTTP header) the currently &ldquo;logged on&rdquo; username. So your application can access this LOGON_USER HTTP header and go from there. I won&rsquo;t get into the details of how to setup integrated windows authentication, but basically the idea is you go into IIS and for a given resource (a folder or a file) on your site you change the directory security to Integrated Windows Authentication. Once this is done, when a client visits your local site (the definition of local depends on the gateway or group policy), IE switches to the &ldquo;intranet site&rdquo; profile which allows the automatic authentication. That&rsquo;s the broad picture. But unfortunately, if the same users visits that same website from another location, say from their home, they will end up getting the ugly NTLM authentication box - and most of the times they don&rsquo;t know what to do. Partly because their experience has changed, at work they were simply &ldquo;logged in&rdquo; without doing anything and now they have to login and often times need to prefix their username with domain username format. That&rsquo;s not good. So it&rsquo;s useful to be able to find out programmatically if integrated windows authentication is available, if it is then you simply login using the integration authentication, otherwise you provide the user with a clean and simple forms authentication system. So let&rsquo;s start with some JavaScript code:</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/how-to-check-if-integrated-windows-authentication-is-available/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/better-presentations/>Better Presentations</a></h1><time datetime=2011-03-04T13:19:16Z class=post-date>Fri, Mar 4, 2011</time><p>You can drastically improve your PowerPoint presentations by simply leveraging <a href=http://www.officelabs.com/projects/pptPlex/Pages/default.aspx><strong>pptPlex</strong></a>!  It’s a add-on for PowerPoint to build dynamic, contextual presentations.

One of the more deceitful concepts in SSIS is it&rsquo;s security context. When you run a SSIS package form your Visual Studio Environment, it obviously runs under a different security context (most possibly as you&ndash;the developer) than it would run if it was run as a scheduled service on the SQL server itself. So let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve developed a SSIS package that uses resources within your domain, such as accessing a network drive. How will SSIS access such a resource? As you may know, SSIS packages are executed by the SQL server agent, which by default uses the native [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM] account1 to execute your packages. Since this is a local account you cannot use it when you need access to resources external to the SQL server box. In order to access domain level resources, you need to use a domain proxy. A domain proxy allows the SQL agent to proxy on an existing domain account when it executes a package. The first step is to create a credential. Connect to your SQL server, expand security, right click credentials and new credential. Fill-in the dialog box to something like this: <a href=/2007/05/domainproxy1.jpg title="SQL 2005 - Credentials"><img src=/2007/05/domainproxy1.thumbnail.jpg alt="SQL 2005 - Credentials"></a> The second step is to create a domain proxy, expand SQL Server Agent, right click proxies and click new proxy. Fill in the dialog box something similar to the image shown on the left. Identity is the domain account you are going to use and the password to the domain account.<br><a href=/2007/05/domainproxy2.jpg title="SQL 2005 - Proxy Accounts"><img src=/2007/05/domainproxy2.thumbnail.jpg alt="SQL 2005 - Proxy Accounts"></a> Once this is done, expand SQL Server Agent, right click Proxies and click on New Proxy. The resulting dialog box should look something like the image on the left. For the credential name use the credential you just made.<br><a href=/2007/05/domainproxy3.jpg title="SQL 2005 - SSIS Run As"><img src=/2007/05/domainproxy3.thumbnail.jpg alt="SQL 2005 - SSIS Run As"></a> Now the last step is to modify the SSIS package to use this proxy account. So right click Jobs under SQL Server Agent, right click the job that you want to run using this proxy account, click properties, go to the steps tab, click on edit at the bottom of the screen. Change Run As to the new proxy account you just created. The resulting dialog box should look something like the image on the left. Make sure the domain account, which you are using during the step when you created the credential, has access to all the network resources this package needs access to. [1] SQL Agent actually does not use the system account but runs in the context of the SQLAgentUser group on the local machine, the [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM] account is by default part of the SQLAgentUser group.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/using-ssis-to-access-network-resources/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/script-task-readingreturning-data/>Script Task reading/returning data</a></h1><time datetime=2007-05-25T23:58:45Z class=post-date>Fri, May 25, 2007</time><p>When you are using the Script Task in SSIS it&rsquo;s often useful to have the script task return data, and also at times useful to have access to external data. Once you drop a Script Task onto the designer and go to it&rsquo;s editor, under the script tab you&rsquo;ll find two attributes: ReadOnlyVariables, ReadWriteVariables. The first allows the script to access external <strong>user variables</strong> for reading, while the latter allows write access. It&rsquo;s important to realize that we are talking about user variables which is usually under the <em>User::</em> namespace. So every variable you list must be prefixed by: User::. If you don&rsquo;t the script assumes System::. So here&rsquo;s a screen shot of what a script task might look like: <a href=/2007/05/script-task1.jpg title="Script Task (Variables)"><img src=/2007/05/script-task1.thumbnail.jpg alt="Script Task (Variables)"></a> Once you click on the design script you get an editor where you are allowed to type VB.NET code. At this point SSIS script tasks do not support C#. Here&rsquo;s a sample of how you can access a user variable and set a value to it. As you can see from the sample code below, SSIS variables are not typed:</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/script-task-readingreturning-data/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/reverse-a-linked-list-recursively/>Reverse a linked list recursively</a></h1><time datetime=2007-05-23T23:26:12Z class=post-date>Wed, May 23, 2007</time><p>A question came up the other day while I was helping a friend of mine about recursively reversing a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list>singly linked list</a>.

It&rsquo;s a very powerful tool and is one of the most flexible firewalls I have seen in the market. Where I work, Microsoft ISA actually replaced several CISCO firewalls. Not only were we able to migrate all the access lists rules we were able to do far more than that. Just so we a sense of our setup we have two Microsoft ISA servers running. One that handles the X subnet and the handles the Y subnet. All of the servers and static-IP workstations are hosted on the Y subnet. The ISA server that firewalls the Y subnet allows more incoming and outgoing ports to facilitate testing, production level data transfer and so on. Me and our system administrators spent almost all day today trying to figure out a solution to a strange problem. When we FTP from the Y subnet (the static subnet) to a external box, we can successfully login because PORT 21 is port. However, after logging in we cannot upload any files. After some researching I found out that FTP does not receive data from PORT 21 but changes the incoming port dynamically which is set using the FTP command PORT or PASV (depending on which mode you are running your client). So even though the primary port is PORT 21 &ndash; it&rsquo;s referred to as the COMMAND PORT. It&rsquo;s not the PORT which is used to send/receive data. Which port will be used is randomly selected using the PORT/PASV command to minimize security issues. The way to fix this issue only seems to be to open a range of outgoing TCP ports above the 1000 range (what this range is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Ephemeral+Port+Range">still remains an issue</a>) it seems to depend on the server &ndash; and worst yet the server configuration. Most FTP servers will allow the emperical port range to change which might cause problems on our ISA server. In any case, the issue hasn&rsquo;t been resolved yet &ndash; but I will definietly post the solution once we find out.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/ftp-microsoft-isa-server-2004/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/recursive-fun-c/>Recursive Fun (C#)</a></h1><time datetime=2005-07-14T02:17:47Z class=post-date>Thu, Jul 14, 2005</time><p>Recursive functions can be a lot of fun!

Partial classes simply means that you can break your class and write them separately (as if they were separate entities). This becomes a useful feature when you have a large class that does more than one thing. If you open a software engineering book, you are likely to find statements like: &ldquo;&mldr;your function/classes should do one thing and do it well&rdquo;. Yes, this is an ideal situation but often times when modeling the real-world the developer is forced to combine multiple funcationlity within one class. This is specially true in a web-environment because there is a tendency to combine UI and logic. <strong>Pros</strong> The .NET model simply does an amazing job of separating design and logic. But with the current model, if you add some controls your classes will contain a list of all the WebControl members such as TextBox, RadioButton and so on. This is really UI and should be separate from the logic of the class. In .NET 2.0 however, you can separate all the UI members and move it to a partial class. Then write another partial class that will contain only the logic side of the page. A far more clearner and easier to maintain technique. <strong>Cons</strong> Since partial classes allow you to separate the class definitions anywhere within the current namespace, there might be a tendency from the developer to have large partial classes that does far too many things. What this does is you have a structured program masked with OOP keywords all over the place, and not a &ldquo;true&rdquo; object-oriented program. To the programmer it might appear as if he/she is using sound software-engineering methodologies because they are using class, structures, delegates and partial classes! Underneath all this keywords however is a flat structured program with lots of functions! So in conclusion, even though partial classes a great way to separate &ldquo;functionality&rdquo; of a class one must be careful and continue to follow sound practices.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/partial-classes/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/xmlhttp/>XMLHttp</a></h1><time datetime=2005-06-11T02:11:40Z class=post-date>Sat, Jun 11, 2005</time><p>XMLHttp is the future of web application development. It allows threaded communication between the client and the server without ever leaving the page. If more advanced JavaScript features are standardized this might mean that a web application will act and feel very much like a regular windows application. Up until now, one of the major differences between a windows application and a web application was statelessness. However, with XMLHttp this is reduced much further because a state will no longer be round-trip from the server, it will be when the user enters a page does several thousand things and leaves the page (when they leave the page the state is lost) however during those thousand events all the state will be maintainted &ndash; this can be done using XMLHttp. <strong>So what is XMLHttp exactly?</strong> XMLHttp allows XML formatted (ideally) data to be passed to a server-side page using client side script. The response from that input can then be read back using a client side script and some actions performed based on that output. Consider this scenario, let&rsquo;s say you are writing a address verification system. Your boss thinks that the user shouldn&rsquo;t have to pick the state because just typing in the zip code should automatically select the appropriate state. In the olden days in order to do this you would have to do a Postback on the server and check the zipcode against your database to resolve the state. With XMLHttp once the user types in the zipcode the zipcode is passed to the server to resolve the state. When the result is found the dropdown box for the state is changed to the appropriate state &ndash; without ever leaving the page. Next time I will post some sample XMLHttp code and discuss this further.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/xmlhttp/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/the-trailing-slash/>The trailing slash</a></h1><time datetime=2005-04-28T00:47:36Z class=post-date>Thu, Apr 28, 2005</time><p>Sometimes a simple change as adding a slash may improve the performance of your web-applications.

But can UIs produce bugs or at least attract the user towards a bug? The answer yes! And these bugs tend to be quite difficult to catch because each user react to the UI in a different way. And the fact that programmers are so used to the behaviors of the default controls in a GUI environment it&rsquo;s hard for them to test the application for UI confusions. Unfortunately this is more true in a web platform than in it is in a let&rsquo;s say windows application. In a windows application the developer has more control and therefore can enforce a UI path whereas in a web-application the user is partially in control. Consider what happens in Gmail for instance, if you write an e-mail and half way through you close the browser by mistake what happens? Gmail will not give you any alerts instead the browser will close and you will have lost everything you typed (assuming you didn&rsquo;t save a draft). Now let&rsquo;s follow through the same steps but this time on a Windows application. Open up outlook and create a new message, now no matter how you want to close the window weather it&rsquo;s closing the &ldquo;New message&rdquo; window or Outlook itself completely you will have to confirm that you don&rsquo;t want to save the message and still quit. Now of course the example I am presenting above is obvious enough that no one makes this mistake. Everyone knows that if you are using Hotmail, Yahoo Mail or Gmail you should save your message first before quitting. But in a complex application (specially when the user is not used to it) this UI problem can get quite scary. This issue came into my attention when I released a fairly large application into production and some of the users were having trouble submiting information to us through the app. After some investigation I realized that it was the UI that was confusing some users. To make long stories short, in a web environment we as programmers must be cautious as to how to design our UIs because we have several boundaries that we have to work against, the lack of control when it comes to UI in a web environment, the statelessness of web-applications and the constant client-server connection all play a role into introducing strange bugs.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/can-uis-produce-bugs/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/optimizing-regular-expressions/>Optimizing Regular Expressions</a></h1><time datetime=2005-02-16T16:23:02Z class=post-date>Wed, Feb 16, 2005</time><p>Optimizing regular expressions is an exceptionally complex field.

To give the letter a texture I added a little bit of monochrome gaussian noise.

In this article I will discuss how we did our state management for the surface the robot is vacuuming.</p><p>In order to maintain the state information for the surface, one of things we had for our intelligent Roomba was a char array (VACUUMED, UNKNOWN, BLOCKED are the possible values for each cell). However a simple array wouldn&rsquo;t work because the robot could be physically placed anywhere on the floor, yet our starting position would always be (0,0). This was a problem. One of the solutions proposed and implemented by many others in my class was to <em>shift</em> the array to accomodate the space in the room. We on the other hand took a different turn; in Microsoft lingo our array was a smart array. Our array acted like a torus which meant that it would wrap around the boundaries. If for instance, the array size is: 60x60 then a reference to the point (70,40) would translate to: (19,40); in this sample case the wrap occured in the x-direction. This took care of the problem of shifting the array. Read on to see the C code for the torus functions.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/torus-smart-array-part-ii/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/vacuum-cleaner/>Vacuum Cleaner</a></h1><time datetime=2004-11-18T00:13:09Z class=post-date>Thu, Nov 18, 2004</time><p>For the past few weeks me and a team of three extremely bright computer science graduate students have been working on a vacuum cleaner. The idea is to design a robot that can clean a room <em>efficiently</em>; the key term here being efficiently. There is an existing product called: <a href=http://www.irobot.com/>Roomba</a> which sells for about $300.00 dollars and does the same thing we are trying to do &ndash; but it does it zero intelligence. Roomba works by vacuuming a room <strong>long enough</strong> to gurantee (probabilistically) that at least 90% of the reachable space within a room will be vacuumed. I say reachable because there could be areas in the room which is not reachable and that&rsquo;s not taken into account. Anyway, so in other words to vacuum a 100 sq. ft. room Roomba would spend around 10-15 (regardless of weather it&rsquo;s filled with objects or not &ndash; because it has no way of knowing), where as a human being would easily vacuum the same room in under 2 minutes (83% gain) with perhaps zero unvacuumed areas. The reason Roomba has to vacuum so long is because it has no way of <em>tracking</em> weather it has been to a specific area in the room (that&rsquo;s partially due to the fact that Roomba runs on only 1~2KB of memory). So a way of guranteeing better coverage is to wonder around in complete disarray for longer hoping to reach that &ldquo;one&rdquo; un-vacuumed area. Of course, no one really complains because who cares if it&rsquo;s vacuuming longer? It&rsquo;s cleaning better right?</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/vacuum-cleaner/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/object-databases-ordbms/>Object Databases (ORDBMS)</a></h1><time datetime=2004-11-10T19:38:02Z class=post-date>Wed, Nov 10, 2004</time><p>ORDBMS - Object Relational, Database Management system. Is an object oriented database management system. The concept at first is a bit suprising since relational database sort of by definition negates the concept of objects. In theory a relational database is a set of relation R; each table, formally known as relations, can be joined (cartesian product) to produce a new relation (which is an improper subset of R1xR2). There are many problems with this scenario. Lets say you want a database that contains sets of points where computers are physically located in a global positioning system. This hypothetical organization contains various departments, a set of departments makes up a local-organization, and a set of local-organization makes up an organization, to make situations worst, each continent can contain several organizations; and there are seven continents. This company is so large they have branches all over the seven continents. The point of this all is to find the minimal net-cost (where cost is distance) for communication between computers.

Multiple animations come up in several scenarios. For instance, if you have a menu that does some animation onmouseover then although not clear at first this menu system could be running multiple animations at the same time. For example, let&rsquo;s say the animation takes 2 secs to run. Then in this 2 second time frame if the user highlights another menu item then the browser is actually running to threads one for each menu item. This is can bring down the performance of the system quite heavily.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/javascript-performance-part-ii/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/javascript-performance-part-i/>JavaScript Performance - Part I</a></h1><time datetime=2004-10-30T02:34:33Z class=post-date>Sat, Oct 30, 2004</time><p>This is the first in a series of articles I plan to write on improving performance in JavaScript heavy web-applications. More specifically I will discuss some of the ways you can improve on JavaScript based animations, reducing object chains, cross-browser DOM, clever ways of writing/designing objects and so on.</p><p><strong>Improving on Animations</strong></p><p>No matter what type of animation it is if it&rsquo;s written using JavaScript it&rsquo;s most likely going to make use of setTimeout or setInterval. Both of these function work like a timeline in Flash and therefore it&rsquo;s ideal for doing animations. To begin with setInterval is much faster than setTimeout. The reason is setInterval causes a function to continously run until it&rsquo;s stopped using clearInterval, where as setTimeout runs a function after a given time and stops; therefore if you wanted to animate something using setTimeout you would somehow have to keep calling setTimeout (until the animation ended) where as in setInterval this is done only once. The down-side of this is setInterval is supported only by Internet Explorer so to get <strong>really</strong> high performance you might want to write one version (separate files) of your JavaScript that&rsquo;s geard towards Internet Explorer and another for Netscape (which supports setTimeout). <em>Next time I will discuss how to run multiple animations at once using one-thread (or one setTimeout or setInterval).</em></p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/javascript-performance-part-i/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/using-xslt-to-view-graphical-poll-results/>Using XSLT to view graphical poll results</a></h1><time datetime=2004-10-21T04:18:47Z class=post-date>Thu, Oct 21, 2004</time><p>How I came to this is not relevant I think, so I will jump straight to the examples.

The idea of the project is that the LEGO mindstorm has to follow a black line on the floor. So I started thinking about this problem and my initial approach was the following: I assume my robot starts ON the black line. So it starts traveling forward and continues until it finds white (which is the floor). At this point it has to turn but which way? To the left or to the right? Perhaps it picks either one of those in random (LEFT or RIGHT) and tries to find black, if it can&rsquo;t find black it turns again and <strong>hopes</strong> to find black in the opposite direction (otherwise it&rsquo;s completely lost). This process seems overly complicated and extremely un-reliable. More importantly if [this is not required in my project] mindstorm had to go the finishing line in the earliest possible time then the above approach would certainly fail because it would have to <strong>search</strong> the black line as opposed to <strong><em>follow</em></strong> the black line. So I had to think of a different approach and I came up with the following: Follow one of the edges of the black line (rather than the whole black line). Even before starting to think about this problem I started to see some of the program&rsquo;s benefits. So let&rsquo;s say I choose to follow the right edge, then the robot should look to the left for white and right for black. Very elegant. The robot would either to make a right or a left. If after turning a little (let&rsquo;s say 5 radians) it finds black it continues to turn in that direction until it finds the edge and then continues in that direction. I am currently working on the latter algorithm and will soon post the C code (<em>actually NQC code</em>) for you guys.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/line-tracker/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/dynamic-contents/>Dynamic contents</a></h1><time datetime=2004-08-06T03:04:04Z class=post-date>Fri, Aug 6, 2004</time><p>Generating dynamic contents can be a great way to allow your users to find information quickly.

As some of you may know I am starting (at least partially) my masters in Computer Science. After much thought. I have decided to focus on the field of: Embedded Software Development. Embedded applications are everywhere. When you use your microwave, drive your car, program your tv, program you DVD player and on and on. Almost all household devices have some software embedded into it. That&rsquo;s how it functions. Of course there has to be someone writing those softwares. I will be that person. About 10 years ago however, a company would hire an Electrical Engineer or a Computer Engineer to do this task. But recently there has been some advancements where Computer Scientists can design the software as if they were writing it for the PC. Then a third party software such as: VeriLog takes the assembly of the software (with the help of some hardware such as EP-ROM writers) and takes care of writing to the device so that the device can function. Of course each devices has to supply an API that can be used to manipulate or get access to information from the actual device. But most devices these days do.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/embedded-software/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/alpha-beta-searching/>Alpha Beta Searching</a></h1><time datetime=2004-05-26T04:58:27Z class=post-date>Wed, May 26, 2004</time><p>I have a test tonight. I am fairly certain I will get an A; however, there is only one thing that I am unsure about: AlphaBeta searching. So I went online and read couple of books. Here&rsquo;s my understanding (in brief of course): AlphaBeta searching is an optimized searching model based on MinMax searching (or MiniMax search). So to understand AlphaBeta searching we must first understand MinMax searching. MinMax searching can be applied on game trees (if you are not familiar with game trees then please <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Game+Trees">go here</a>). The MinMax comes from the fact that the searching algorithm alternates between searching for a maximum value, and a minimum value. For instance, if it&rsquo;s the computers move then the computer searches for a maximum node (when I refer to maximum I am referring to the move-value which is the heuristic value for that move). On the other hand, when it turn for the opponents move the computer searches for a MIN value and so on. AlphaBeta searching improves on the MinMax algorithm with the following assumption. Lets say you know a node K is better than node K&rsquo; and you can prove that the best possible move can be K then how much better is K than K&rsquo; is absolutely irrelivant because no matter what value K&rsquo; is you will end up choosing K because K is the best move. Therefore if K&rsquo; had a subtree none of that needs to be computed which eventually saves tremendous amount of time.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/alpha-beta-searching/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/unique-elements-in-xslt/>Unique Elements (in XSLT)</a></h1><time datetime=2004-05-05T23:58:32Z class=post-date>Wed, May 5, 2004</time><p>At work I have this XML document that lists all the employees along with their responsiblities.

The problem with generating random numbers is finding a true source of entropy. The usual rand() or RND function found in most languages use the system clock as the source of entropy. This is perhaps the worst method of generating a random number; the reason being the change of entropy is predictable (because the change of time is predictable &ndash; the millisecond counter changes 1/1000 sec). One technique (a technique used by PGP) uses other random sources from your computer. For instance mouse movements, thread counts or whatever else. The above techniques works wonders if you only want to generate small sets of random numbers. If you want to generate larger sets then you start to see recognizable patterns (this happens perhaps because you start of have predictable mouse movements, predictable thread counts and so on). I am working on a project that requires large sets of random numbers with low levels of predictability (note this level is not to be confused with the entropy value that is often paired with random numbers; what I am referring to here is the chi-square value). So as I was researching around the internet I came across this web-site: <a href=http://www.random.org/>www.random.org</a>. All they do is produce random numbers. The way the <a href=http://www.random.org/>random.org</a> random number generator works is quite simple. A radio is tuned into a frequency where nobody is broadcasting. The atmospheric noise picked up by the receiver is fed into a Sun SPARC workstation through the microphone port where it is sampled by a program as an eight bit mono signal at a frequency of 8KHz. The upper seven bits of each sample are discarded immediately and the remaining bits are gathered and turned into a stream of bits with a high content of entropy. Skew correction is performed on the bit stream, in order to ensure that there is an approximately even distribution of 0s and 1s. Recently they added a <a href=http://www.random.org/soap.html>SOAP interface</a> to their application; so what I will do is use their SOAP interface to receive some data and use that for my application. I will post the link to the resulting page as soon as I am done.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/random-numbers/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/unification/>Unification</a></h1><time datetime=2004-04-02T18:51:33Z class=post-date>Fri, Apr 2, 2004</time><p>In PROLOG there is an idea called: unification. It&rsquo;s similar to setting a variable to something but there are certainly several difference (otherwise it would be called assignment). One major difference in unification is pattern matching. For instance if I had the following code segment in PROLOG</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-javascript data-lang=javascript><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#a6e22e>X</span> <span style=color:#f92672>/</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>Y</span> <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>10</span> <span style=color:#f92672>/</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>a</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then the variable X will be assigned 10 and the variable Y will be assigned a. This is very powerful tool. Unification however has some limitations.

It has been almost 5 weeks now since I have been taking this course; and I strongly believe that every programmer should take at least one course in a logic programming class. I feel a course of this type will open the mind so greatly that it will not only help one program in other languages but help in several other aspects of one&rsquo;s life. In institutions like Caltech and MIT, PROLOG is a required course for any computer science students. Unfortunately that&rsquo;s not the case in my university (@ CSUN). A one paragraph idea behind PROLOG is the following: thinking of logic as a method of computation. In all other structured/object-oriented you cannot explicitly supply the core-logic &ndash; instead you have to find an algorithm that when followed will compute something logical. There is a vast difference between the two. They require completely different method of thinking. One of these days I will post a sample code written in PROLOG and perhaps to compare the same program in C#.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/prolog/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://www.salmanq.com/blog/verifying-your-site-is-running/>Verifying your site is running?</a></h1><time datetime=2004-03-02T08:00:00Z class=post-date>Tue, Mar 2, 2004</time><p>This question often comes up-how do you make sure that your site is running? One solution is to run tools like <a href=http://www.ipswitch.com/products/whatsup/index.asp>WhatsUp Gold</a> that monitors your IIS service status, SQL service status etc. As long as these services respond as saying they are running, WhatsUp gold is happy. But unfortunately, the fact that these services are running does not mean that your website is functioning to the public. For example if you have a page that depends on an external web service, and for some reason the external web service is down, then your page will not respond and will eventually time out. To the public your site is down. WhatsUp gold is not necessarily going to check for that. I say not necessarily because it is possible to have WhatsUp gold monitor HTTP status, but that creates a strong coupling between WhatsUp gold and generic application development.</p><div class=read-more-link><a href=/blog/verifying-your-site-is-running/>Read More…</a></div></article></div></main></body></html>
