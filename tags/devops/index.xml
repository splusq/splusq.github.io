I decided to use &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and host all of the content in &lt;a href="https://github.com/splusq/splusq.github.io"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I am even able to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions"&gt;Github Actions&lt;/a&gt; to manage the continuous integration/delivery of the source to &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; all entirely for free. While Github Pages, and Hugo both generate static html pages, I was able to enable comments, via &lt;a href="https://utteranc.es"&gt;utteranc.es&lt;/a&gt; which stores the comments in Github as issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall experience is wonderful, clean and simple. The writing experience is also very enjoyable since markdown is a lot more predictable compared to WYSIWYG editors most WordPress authors rely on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Azure service monitoring</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/azure-service-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2013 01:09:37 +0000</pubDate><author>Salman Quazi</author><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/azure-service-monitoring/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring your Azure services couldn&amp;rsquo;t get easier. Windows Azure recently released a capability to test connectivity of your service (REST or website) from over three continents. It&amp;rsquo;s super simple to setup. Login to your azure management console, add your website URL to monitor and select up to three locations to monitor from: &lt;img src="https://www.salmanq.com/2013/03/azure-monitoring.png" alt="azure monitoring"&gt; With that you can start getting response time, and uptime reports (my uptime was 100% so I didn&amp;rsquo;t show it here): &lt;img src="https://www.salmanq.com/2013/03/azure-monreport.png" alt="azure website monitoring report"&gt; In this case, Violet is Chicago, Blue is Hong Kong, and Green is Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using SSIS to Access Network Resources</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/using-ssis-to-access-network-resources/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 May 2007 01:38:29 +0000</pubDate><author>Salman Quazi</author><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/using-ssis-to-access-network-resources/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) is the replacement for DTS in SQL 2005. One of the more deceitful concepts in SSIS is it&amp;rsquo;s security context. When you run a SSIS package form your Visual Studio Environment, it obviously runs under a different security context (most possibly as you&amp;ndash;the developer) than it would run if it was run as a scheduled service on the SQL server itself. So let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve developed a SSIS package that uses resources within your domain, such as accessing a network drive. How will SSIS access such a resource? As you may know, SSIS packages are executed by the SQL server agent, which by default uses the native [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM] account1 to execute your packages. Since this is a local account you cannot use it when you need access to resources external to the SQL server box. In order to access domain level resources, you need to use a domain proxy. A domain proxy allows the SQL agent to proxy on an existing domain account when it executes a package. The first step is to create a credential. Connect to your SQL server, expand security, right click credentials and new credential. Fill-in the dialog box to something like this: &lt;a href="https://www.salmanq.com/2007/05/domainproxy1.jpg" title="SQL 2005 - Credentials"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.salmanq.com/2007/05/domainproxy1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="SQL 2005 - Credentials"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The second step is to create a domain proxy, expand SQL Server Agent, right click proxies and click new proxy. Fill in the dialog box something similar to the image shown on the left. Identity is the domain account you are going to use and the password to the domain account.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.salmanq.com/2007/05/domainproxy2.jpg" title="SQL 2005 - Proxy Accounts"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.salmanq.com/2007/05/domainproxy2.thumbnail.jpg" alt="SQL 2005 - Proxy Accounts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Once this is done, expand SQL Server Agent, right click Proxies and click on New Proxy. The resulting dialog box should look something like the image on the left. For the credential name use the credential you just made.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.salmanq.com/2007/05/domainproxy3.jpg" title="SQL 2005 - SSIS Run As"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.salmanq.com/2007/05/domainproxy3.thumbnail.jpg" alt="SQL 2005 - SSIS Run As"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Now the last step is to modify the SSIS package to use this proxy account. So right click Jobs under SQL Server Agent, right click the job that you want to run using this proxy account, click properties, go to the steps tab, click on edit at the bottom of the screen. Change Run As to the new proxy account you just created. The resulting dialog box should look something like the image on the left. Make sure the domain account, which you are using during the step when you created the credential, has access to all the network resources this package needs access to. [1] SQL Agent actually does not use the system account but runs in the context of the SQLAgentUser group on the local machine, the [NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM] account is by default part of the SQLAgentUser group.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>FTP &amp; Microsoft ISA Server 2004</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/ftp-microsoft-isa-server-2004/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2005 13:31:57 +0000</pubDate><author>Salman Quazi</author><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/ftp-microsoft-isa-server-2004/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/default.mspx"&gt;Microsoft ISA (Internet Security and Acceleration Server) 2004&lt;/a&gt; is a tool to secure and accelerate (as the name suggests) networks running on Windows platforms. It&amp;rsquo;s a very powerful tool and is one of the most flexible firewalls I have seen in the market. Where I work, Microsoft ISA actually replaced several CISCO firewalls. Not only were we able to migrate all the access lists rules we were able to do far more than that. Just so we a sense of our setup we have two Microsoft ISA servers running. One that handles the X subnet and the handles the Y subnet. All of the servers and static-IP workstations are hosted on the Y subnet. The ISA server that firewalls the Y subnet allows more incoming and outgoing ports to facilitate testing, production level data transfer and so on. Me and our system administrators spent almost all day today trying to figure out a solution to a strange problem. When we FTP from the Y subnet (the static subnet) to a external box, we can successfully login because PORT 21 is port. However, after logging in we cannot upload any files. After some researching I found out that FTP does not receive data from PORT 21 but changes the incoming port dynamically which is set using the FTP command PORT or PASV (depending on which mode you are running your client). So even though the primary port is PORT 21 &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s referred to as the COMMAND PORT. It&amp;rsquo;s not the PORT which is used to send/receive data. Which port will be used is randomly selected using the PORT/PASV command to minimize security issues. The way to fix this issue only seems to be to open a range of outgoing TCP ports above the 1000 range (what this range is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=Ephemeral+Port+Range"&gt;still remains an issue&lt;/a&gt;) it seems to depend on the server &amp;ndash; and worst yet the server configuration. Most FTP servers will allow the emperical port range to change which might cause problems on our ISA server. In any case, the issue hasn&amp;rsquo;t been resolved yet &amp;ndash; but I will definietly post the solution once we find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Volume Backup</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/volume-backup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2004 16:23:20 +0000</pubDate><author>Salman Quazi</author><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/volume-backup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to work on a system/method to perform incremental backup over the network (using SAMBA). Here are some of the steps I have taken&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I decided on the set of data that needs to be backed up. Since the very beginning all my data files (such as documents, programs, musics and so on) are kept in a completely separate drive. This drive (although large in size) is used only for my personal stuff and I never install anything or create any dependencies on this drive. This helps me be independent in case of an operating system crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Verifying your site is running?</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/verifying-your-site-is-running/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2004 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Salman Quazi</author><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/verifying-your-site-is-running/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This question often comes up-how do you make sure that your site is running? One solution is to run tools like &lt;a href="http://www.ipswitch.com/products/whatsup/index.asp"&gt;WhatsUp Gold&lt;/a&gt; that monitors your IIS service status, SQL service status etc. As long as these services respond as saying they are running, WhatsUp gold is happy. But unfortunately, the fact that these services are running does not mean that your website is functioning to the public. For example if you have a page that depends on an external web service, and for some reason the external web service is down, then your page will not respond and will eventually time out. To the public your site is down. WhatsUp gold is not necessarily going to check for that. I say not necessarily because it is possible to have WhatsUp gold monitor HTTP status, but that creates a strong coupling between WhatsUp gold and generic application development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
