I decided to use Hugo and host all of the content in Github. I am even able to use Github Actions to manage the continuous integration/delivery of the source to Github Pages all entirely for free. While Github Pages, and Hugo both generate static html pages, I was able to enable comments, via utteranc.es which stores the comments in Github as issues.</description></item><item><title>5 things you probably didn't know about .NET WebSockets</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-net-websockets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 23:45:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-net-websockets/</guid><description>As most of you probably already know WebSocket provides full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection. .NET 4.5 added support for WebSockets as part of the BCL. In this article I am going to talk about few of the subtleties that you need to think about.
Connection upgrade is somewhat expensive WebSocket connections are initiated as traditional HTTP connections. The client then usually requests an &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; to a WebSocket session, this upgrade process is relatively expensive.</description></item><item><title>Building a service execution pipeline</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/building-a-service-execution-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 05:19:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/building-a-service-execution-pipeline/</guid><description>Most software built today have a notion of a client and a service. This is even more true with mobile/web applications because you want your client apps to do as little as possible, and your service to do most of the heavy lifting. This allows you to improve your service without requiring constant client updates. Also since you have a single service that serves potentially various native clients (iOS, Android, or Windows Phone), being able to update it independently of your users gives you a clear competitive edge.</description></item><item><title>Self-Awareness</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/self-awareness/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2013 05:37:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/self-awareness/</guid><description>Sebastian Junger (pronounced Younger) was on Bill Maher last night. Junger is an award winning Afghanistan war correspondent, and director, and his latest documentary Which way is the front line from here? has been proclaimed a success at the Sundance Film Festival this year.

It&amp;rsquo;s a specialization within the field of artificial intelligence, which is often thought of as a theoretical study than practical applications. But yet, machine learning today is used heavily to solve problems. Our team for instance, uses it to build acoustic models for speech recognition. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer a theory, it&amp;rsquo;s applied science. But if you wanted to start in this field, which I suspect is going to play a major role in software in the future, where do you start?</description></item><item><title>.NET and Node.JS - Performance Comparison (Updated)</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/net-and-node-js-performance-comparison/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 08:57:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/net-and-node-js-performance-comparison/</guid><description>Update (3/31/2013 - 11:41 PM PST):
This article has been updated! As most readers have commented the node.js async package is not asynchronous, which is what the original article was based on. I made an assumption I should not have. I have since rerun the tests taking this into account, as well as some of the changes recommended by Guillaume Lecomte. I have decided to update this existing post so that there&amp;rsquo;s no confusion in the future with the data.</description></item><item><title>Improving Wordpress site speed on IIS</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/improving-wordpress-site-speed-on-iis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2013 19:03:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/improving-wordpress-site-speed-on-iis/</guid><description>One of the first things I did when I started this blog was to change the way static files are cached by IIS to improve site speed. Static files are things that aren&amp;rsquo;t going to change, things like CSS, JavaScript, images, documents, and so on. With IIS this is actually quite easy to achieve, you can start by making the following change to your web.config:
&amp;lt;system.webServer&amp;gt; &amp;lt;staticContent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;clientCache cacheControlMode=&amp;#34;UseMaxAge&amp;#34; cacheControlMaxAge=&amp;#34;7.00:00:00&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/staticContent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/system.</description></item><item><title>Ads</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/ads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2013 17:34:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/ads/</guid><description>Came across this wonderful quote from Jeff Hammerbacher: &amp;ldquo;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads&amp;rdquo;.

One of my preferred approach to extending behaviors is composition, and that is what we are going to talk about today. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple example of inheritance:
public class Search : ISearch { IEnumerable&amp;lt;SearchResults&amp;gt; Search(Query q); } public class Related : Search { IEnumerable&amp;lt;RelatedEntities&amp;gt; Related(Query q); } So in this simple example, we extend Search and create Related - which provides some additional functionality.</description></item><item><title>Azure service monitoring</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/azure-service-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2013 01:09:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/azure-service-monitoring/</guid><description>Monitoring your Azure services couldn&amp;rsquo;t get easier. Windows Azure recently released a capability to test connectivity of your service (REST or website) from over three continents. It&amp;rsquo;s super simple to setup. Login to your azure management console, add your website URL to monitor and select up to three locations to monitor from: With that you can start getting response time, and uptime reports (my uptime was 100% so I didn&amp;rsquo;t show it here): In this case, Violet is Chicago, Blue is Hong Kong, and Green is Amsterdam.</description></item><item><title>C-Sharp as a scripting language</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/c-sharp-as-a-scripting-language/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2013 04:49:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/c-sharp-as-a-scripting-language/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a cool technology you might not have heard of: scriptcs.

Today we are going to take a step further and build a mechanism to use the MVVM pattern on traditional web applications. Imagine how powerful it would be if your UI could evolve independently. We are going to build a simple web application that will display top 5 &amp;ldquo;memory intensive&amp;rdquo; processes on the server side, and here&amp;rsquo;s our basic architecture: Recall, with MVVM we need the ability for our ViewModels to somehow send messages to the UI.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft on{x} - Automate your life</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/microsoft-onx-automate-your-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2013 19:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/microsoft-onx-automate-your-life/</guid><description>Microsoft on{x} is a set of services built by the team I work for. On{x} allows you to configure arbitrary actions during specific circumstances. For instance, on{x} provides an API called modeOfTransport. This API gives the developer the current mode of transportation - whether you are walking, running or driving. You can subscribe to a change in this event and build cool scenarios like when someone is going from driving to walking (imagine parking a car), your phone can automatically remember your parking location.</description></item><item><title>How do you test your software?</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/how-do-you-test-your-software/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 15:09:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/how-do-you-test-your-software/</guid><description>There seems to be two types of developers out there. One that believes in integration tests, and the other that believes in both unit and integration tests. Integration tests are tests that execute everything as if they were real &amp;ldquo;transactions&amp;rdquo; only to verify the expected results. For instance, if you were building a web application that managed a list of employees and their supervisors. Your integration test would probably add an employee to the database (actually add it), and then read it back from that database, and so on (from a test database of course).</description></item><item><title>Using the MVVM pattern on web applications â€“ Part I</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/using-the-mvvm-pattern-on-web-applications-part-i/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 09:01:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/using-the-mvvm-pattern-on-web-applications-part-i/</guid><description>In this series I will be discussing how the MVVM pattern can be used for almost any type of web application. MVVM (a variant on the MVP pattern) - is a really powerful pattern that can be used in UI applications. Traditionally these UI applications has been WPF and Silverlight. In this article I will show you how you can use the same principles to build web applications. With MVVM you have the following three ideas:</description></item><item><title>Learning to program</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/learning-to-program/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2013 04:42:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/learning-to-program/</guid><description>If you or your kids want to learn how to program - you can start here: http://www.code.org/.

For instance, if you make an asynchronous WebRequest call â€“ you may want to timeout this asynchronous operation within 3 seconds if you donâ€™t get a response back. In the past, we had to create Timers to monitor the Task (or the Thread) for completion in the callback of the timer, and then do other crazy gymnastics to make it all play well together.</description></item><item><title>Brief introduction to PRISM</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/brief-introduction-to-prism/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2011 14:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/brief-introduction-to-prism/</guid><description>Before I go into the technical details of this article. I want to provide some context for this discussion. So we are usingÂ PRISMÂ to develop a user-interface (UI) platform in the context of a Silverlight (but they apply to WPF also). The idea behind the UI platform is we will provide the basic functional look and feel and various plumbing (such as security, service encapsulation, messaging and exception handling, among others) and allow others to develop modules/components on top.</description></item><item><title>How to check if Integrated Windows Authentication is available?</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/how-to-check-if-integrated-windows-authentication-is-available/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2011 13:13:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/how-to-check-if-integrated-windows-authentication-is-available/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked on an intranet site, you often want to know, programmatically, if a client that&amp;rsquo;s accessing your website has the ability to automatically login to your site (Integrated Windows Authentication). With Integration Windows Authentication, Windows can basically send (as a HTTP header) the currently &amp;ldquo;logged on&amp;rdquo; username. So your application can access this LOGON_USER HTTP header and go from there. I won&amp;rsquo;t get into the details of how to setup integrated windows authentication, but basically the idea is you go into IIS and for a given resource (a folder or a file) on your site you change the directory security to Integrated Windows Authentication.</description></item><item><title>Better Presentations</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/better-presentations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2011 13:19:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/better-presentations/</guid><description>You can drastically improve your PowerPoint presentations by simply leveraging pptPlex!Â Itâ€™s a add-on for PowerPoint to build dynamic, contextual presentations.

One of the more deceitful concepts in SSIS is it&amp;rsquo;s security context. When you run a SSIS package form your Visual Studio Environment, it obviously runs under a different security context (most possibly as you&amp;ndash;the developer) than it would run if it was run as a scheduled service on the SQL server itself. So let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve developed a SSIS package that uses resources within your domain, such as accessing a network drive.</description></item><item><title>Script Task reading/returning data</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/script-task-readingreturning-data/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2007 23:58:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/script-task-readingreturning-data/</guid><description>When you are using the Script Task in SSIS it&amp;rsquo;s often useful to have the script task return data, and also at times useful to have access to external data. Once you drop a Script Task onto the designer and go to it&amp;rsquo;s editor, under the script tab you&amp;rsquo;ll find two attributes: ReadOnlyVariables, ReadWriteVariables. The first allows the script to access external user variables for reading, while the latter allows write access.</description></item><item><title>Reverse a linked list recursively</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/reverse-a-linked-list-recursively/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2007 23:26:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/reverse-a-linked-list-recursively/</guid><description>A question came up the other day while I was helping a friend of mine about recursively reversing a singly linked list. The moment I heard about it I came up with a solution, but turns out the solution requires the function to accept the following signature:

For example, when you say:
&amp;lt;asp:textbox id=&amp;#34;FirstName&amp;#34; runat=&amp;#34;server&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; You have very limited control over how the control actually renders. You can specify a cssclass to modify the look and feel, but the actual HTML rendering is limited to what&amp;rsquo;s available from the ASP.NET server attributes. For example you cannot add client-side onfocus or onblur statements.

Parent Child 0 1 1 9 9 7 7 2 The parent of 2 is 7 and 7&amp;rsquo;s parent is nine and 9&amp;rsquo;s parent is one and so on until finally 1 who parent is 0 signifying no parent.</description></item><item><title>Typed ToArray() from ArrayList</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/typed-toarray-from-arraylist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2005 07:47:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/typed-toarray-from-arraylist/</guid><description>To get a typed Array of type int [] from an ArrayList you can do the following:

Partial classes simply means that you can break your class and write them separately (as if they were separate entities). This becomes a useful feature when you have a large class that does more than one thing.

It allows threaded communication between the client and the server without ever leaving the page. If more advanced JavaScript features are standardized this might mean that a web application will act and feel very much like a regular windows application. Up until now, one of the major differences between a windows application and a web application was statelessness. However, with XMLHttp this is reduced much further because a state will no longer be round-trip from the server, it will be when the user enters a page does several thousand things and leaves the page (when they leave the page the state is lost) however during those thousand events all the state will be maintainted &amp;ndash; this can be done using XMLHttp.</description></item><item><title>The trailing slash</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/the-trailing-slash/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2005 00:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/the-trailing-slash/</guid><description>Sometimes a simple change as adding a slash may improve the performance of your web-applications. Consider this: the link www.salmanq.com is slower than www.salmanq.com/ (the only difference being the trailing slash). They will both work but the latter is faster. When this link: www.onupol.com is followed the web-server returns a 301 (Moved Permanently) pointing to www.salmanq.com/ that&amp;rsquo;s one extra round trip to and from the server per link. If you have a site that&amp;rsquo;s running without the trailing slash and you have 10K+ visitors you will certainly start to feel the consequence.</description></item><item><title>Old bugs are harder to catch</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/old-bugs-are-harder-to-catch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2005 03:18:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/old-bugs-are-harder-to-catch/</guid><description>About three years ago I worked on an application that in-part had to blend in with several other applications.

A vast majority of the problems within this field is NP or NP-COMPLETE. Meaning that their solutions cannot be bound (time/space) under any definite polynomial.
All APIs (such as: .NET, PHP, ASP (classic VB really), JavaScript) that support regular expressions performs some form of equivalence reduction meaning it tries to reduce the given regular expression into a reduced YET equivalent regular expression. Of course there is no full-proof way of doing this for couple of reasons: (1) There is no way to guarantee that a reduced regular expression is the most efficient regular expression possible.</description></item><item><title>Faster table rendering</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/faster-table-rendering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2005 23:55:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/faster-table-rendering/</guid><description>Unlike FireFox, Internet Explorer does not display a table until the complete table data has arrived.

As some of you may know I am starting (at least partially) my masters in Computer Science. After much thought. I have decided to focus on the field of: Embedded Software Development. Embedded applications are everywhere. When you use your microwave, drive your car, program your tv, program you DVD player and on and on. Almost all household devices have some software embedded into it.</description></item><item><title>Alpha Beta Searching</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/alpha-beta-searching/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2004 04:58:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/alpha-beta-searching/</guid><description>I have a test tonight. I am fairly certain I will get an A; however, there is only one thing that I am unsure about: AlphaBeta searching. So I went online and read couple of books. Here&amp;rsquo;s my understanding (in brief of course): AlphaBeta searching is an optimized searching model based on MinMax searching (or MiniMax search). So to understand AlphaBeta searching we must first understand MinMax searching. MinMax searching can be applied on game trees (if you are not familiar with game trees then please go here).</description></item><item><title>Unique Elements (in XSLT)</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/unique-elements-in-xslt/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2004 23:58:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/unique-elements-in-xslt/</guid><description>At work I have this XML document that lists all the employees along with their responsiblities.

I feel this is an extremely important field because it allows us to measure the difficulty-level (or complexity of a problem). Without it, it would be like trying to lift a box without knowing how much it weighs.
For instance, how complex is it to sort N numbers? Using standard notation it turns out the best possible solution can be: O(n*lg(n)) (we can prove that this is the best possible solution).</description></item><item><title>CSS: word-wrap</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/css-word-wrap/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2004 23:58:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/css-word-wrap/</guid><description>You will notice this blog site will not overflow in the x-direction no matter what resolution you view this site in (I tried upto 640x480). When you have a div area and you are using PRE or XMP to view formatted contents (like I do in this page to view code) within that div &amp;ndash; this would be almost impossible to do. Here&amp;rsquo;s the reason: unless otherwise stated a PRE or an XMP is displayed as is.</description></item><item><title>Power of PROLOG</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/power-of-prolog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2004 18:01:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/power-of-prolog/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s yet another example of the power available to you in PROLOG. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider this simultaneous equation:
3x + 4y = 17 4x + 3y = 18 In PROLOG I can find the values of X and Y just like this:
compute(X,Y):- fd_domain([X,Y],0,1000), 3*X + 4*Y #= 17, 4*X + 3*Y #= 18. That almost seems like I am joking &amp;ndash; but I am really not. That 3 lines of code will find all solutions to X and Y.</description></item><item><title>Constraint Logic Programming</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/constraint-logic-programming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2004 06:07:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/constraint-logic-programming/</guid><description>PROLOG can is one of many languages that can be used to perform Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). Just like C++ and Visual Basic can be used to program Object Oriented Programs (OOP). Same idea.
The idea behind CLP is the following: give contraints to a problem and request all solutions. For instance, if I had:
X+Y=100 Suppose I wanted to find all the integer solutions to this problem it would be very difficult to code in a regular language (not so much in this specific case because it&amp;rsquo;s too simple, but in general).</description></item><item><title>Hiding Elements During Printing</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/hiding-elements-during-printing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2004 02:15:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/hiding-elements-during-printing/</guid><description>I work in an environment where my collegues surrounding me strongly believe there is no difference between &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Excel&amp;rdquo; and the web. One of the arguments I almost always hear: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;why can&amp;rsquo;t you do it? it can be done in excel &amp;ndash; see!&amp;rdquo;.
So that&amp;rsquo;s how it all started; Excel apparently has a feature that allows a user to hide certain elements from the spreadsheet during print-out; I am not sure how exactly it&amp;rsquo;s done, I am not an Excel expert.</description></item><item><title>Volume Backup</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/volume-backup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2004 16:23:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/volume-backup/</guid><description>I am trying to work on a system/method to perform incremental backup over the network (using SAMBA). Here are some of the steps I have taken&amp;hellip;
First I decided on the set of data that needs to be backed up. Since the very beginning all my data files (such as documents, programs, musics and so on) are kept in a completely separate drive. This drive (although large in size) is used only for my personal stuff and I never install anything or create any dependencies on this drive.</description></item><item><title>Random Numbers</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/random-numbers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2004 15:41:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/random-numbers/</guid><description>There are tons of masters, PhD thesis written on generating uniform (as in uniform distribution) random numbers using a computer. The problem with generating random numbers is finding a true source of entropy. The usual rand() or RND function found in most languages use the system clock as the source of entropy. This is perhaps the worst method of generating a random number; the reason being the change of entropy is predictable (because the change of time is predictable &amp;ndash; the millisecond counter changes 1/1000 sec).</description></item><item><title>Unification</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/unification/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2004 18:51:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/unification/</guid><description>In PROLOG there is an idea called: unification. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to setting a variable to something but there are certainly several difference (otherwise it would be called assignment). One major difference in unification is pattern matching. For instance if I had the following code segment in PROLOG
X / Y = 10 / a Then the variable X will be assigned 10 and the variable Y will be assigned a. This is very powerful tool.</description></item><item><title>AccessKey</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/accesskey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2004 21:58:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/accesskey/</guid><description>Almost all HTML/XHTML tags have an attribute called: accesskey. What this does is allows the programmer to assign key-codes to elements in the page. For instance, if I did this:
Search: &amp;lt;input type=&amp;#34;text&amp;#34; name=&amp;#34;Search&amp;#34; value=&amp;#34;&amp;#34; access=&amp;#34;S&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; Then the user could enter: ALT+S to jump to this field no matter where they are on the page. This feature can make a web-site very user friendly. For instance to jump to search field on this page enter: ALT+4.</description></item><item><title>SICP</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/sicp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2004 21:25:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/sicp/</guid><description>Structure and Interpretaition of Computer Program is often considered one of the greatest books written on LISP or generally program structure (as the name suggests).

register int a; a ^= a; After a bit of thought I realized that &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; gets initialized to zero. But why do it that way when you can do it like this:
int a; a = 0; The answer lies in the machine translation for each of these segments. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at it one piece at a time. The first code segment requests &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; to be part of one of the several general paramenter registers in the CPU.</description></item><item><title>PROLOG</title><link>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/prolog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2004 07:01:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.salmanq.com/blog/prolog/</guid><description>This semester I am taking a course in PROLOG. It has been almost 5 weeks now since I have been taking this course; and I strongly believe that every programmer should take at least one course in a logic programming class.

One solution is to run tools like WhatsUp Gold that monitors your IIS service status, SQL service status etc. As long as these services respond as saying they are running, WhatsUp gold is happy. But unfortunately, the fact that these services are running does not mean that your website is functioning to the public. For example if you have a page that depends on an external web service, and for some reason the external web service is down, then your page will not respond and will eventually time out.</description></item></channel></rss>
