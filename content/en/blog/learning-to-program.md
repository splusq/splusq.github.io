If you or your kids want to learn how to program - you can start here: [http://www.code.org/](http://www.code.org/). For instance, justÂ [see this example](http://www.code.org/learn/khan-academy). You have a great editor, where you can type and see results immediately on the right. On top of that, you have a video, with someone talking you through basic ideas like functions, and parameters. The site has support from top names like [Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc). And if all this wasn't enough - just think for a second by 2020, there will be 1,000,000 (that's a million) [more jobs than there will be students](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/22/code-org-launches-to-help-make-computer-programming-accessible-to-everyone/) who know how to code. Not that you'd want to learn something just because there's a job out there. But the numbers show the scale of the problem we are heading towards.
