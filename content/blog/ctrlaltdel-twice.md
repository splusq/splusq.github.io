In Windows XP pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL twice in the login screen will take you to the classic login screen where you can manually type in the username and password to authenticate yourself. [According to a Microsoft employee](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/14/466051.aspx) this feature maybe removed in future releases of Windows or worst yet it might be removed in future service packs. This would have caused serious problems for me because non-of the users I have on the intial list are administrators to the system. That means without that feature I wouldn't have been able to login to the computer as an administrator (_unless I did run-as on computer management MMC and made myself administrator and then loged as me again_). But just a note that whoever is depending on this should be aware!
