You can drastically improve your PowerPoint presentations by simply leveraging [**pptPlex**](http://www.officelabs.com/projects/pptPlex/Pages/default.aspx)!  It’s a add-on for PowerPoint to build dynamic, contextual presentations. Contextual presentations allows your viewers to see the global context of your discussion, which in turn helps them to follow your line of thought. [Watch some of the videos on the pptPlex website](http://www.officelabs.com/projects/pptPlex/Pages/default.aspx) to see what’s possible.
