Generating dynamic contents can be a great way to allow your users to find information quickly. In [this example](/sources/dynamic-index.php) the page headlines menu option was created dynamically (using JavaScript). In this case the contents was generated dynamically using H3 tags it can be very easily modified to read H1,H2, IMG, IFRAME, SPAN, DIV or any other tag that comes to mind (except perhaps BR :-))
