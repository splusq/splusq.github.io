[Structure and Interpretaition of Computer Program](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) is often considered one of the greatest books written on LISP or generally program structure (as the name suggests). Strangely enough the book is now available freely (through MIT) at: [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) One of my favorite quotes happens to be written in the Preface section of the first edition of this book: "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."
